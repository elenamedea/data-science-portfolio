Because we are 
Always in the sun 
We had to 
Don't worry about these little things 
Who corrupt your life 
And make you live deep inside the law

Many good friends
They part of your entourage
They still teach you how to smile 
Sometimes you're sad 
Will you still get the choice
To enjoy the pleasure of the life 
Hey grace 
Sunlight is where we are 
Don't you know that earth is paradise 
Please don't be sad 
The sun still can't kiss the moon 
And a velvet valley of the nights 

Just be proud
To breath under the sunshine 

Between the future and the past 

With all your friends
Under the Neptune sky
Far from flowers who will be due
We're not all born
Under the same star 
No black cloud in the sky 
We're still walking 
On the wild side 
Even against the shadow of the most

Always in the sun 
I don't know why sometimes my eyes only see the light 
With pain 
Erase the darkness in my veins 
Even if the sun's going down, you'll never be lost or drowned
Alright, come with me beyond the sun 

Please come 
We're always in the sun 
Still waiting for your smile 
Let's take a sunbath
Behind cars we sway sway
I know it's hard to close your eyes 

Hey 
We're always in the sun 
Please come 
Have a seat where we are 
Face to face
Atomic rain
We're floating B-E-A-M
B-E-A-M
B-E-A-M

Always in the sun 
The sun 
Always in the sun 
Always in the sun 
Always in the sun
