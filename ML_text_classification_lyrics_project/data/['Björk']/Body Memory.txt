The snow of winter
I'm walking hills and valleys
Adore this mystical fog
This fucking mist
These cliffs are just showing off
Then the body memory kicks in
I mime my whole mountains
The moss that I'm made of
I redeem myself

I've been wrestling my fate
Do I accept this ending?
Will I accept my death?
Or struggle claustrophobic?
But, like a wolverine
With my destiny
Refuse to accept what was meant to be

Then the body memory kicks in, and I trust the unknown
Fossil my whole imagination
Surrender to future

How to capture all this love
And find a pathway before it
Like threading an ocean through a needle
Ribbon through a keyhole
Can't fathom the grasp
I can't grasp the fathom
Then the body memory kicks in
My limbs and tongue take over
Like the ancestors before me
Show me the flow

My sexual DNA
X-rays of my Kama Sutra
Summons different bodies
Conquers my spine and battle
Embark a nest
Then my body memory kicks in
It simply takes over
Beastiality
I redeem my body

I wasn't partnered then
Toxic doesn't agree with me
A love lured me here
Into a stagnant state
My myths, my customs, ridiculed
Vacuum-packed molecules
Then my body memory kicks in
On this Brooklyn dance floor
Sweating with these rhythms
Rotate this matrix

I'm trapped in legal harness
Kafka-esque with force like patriarchy
Avoid it to confront it
The body memory kicks in
My warrior vacance
My turn to defend
Urban didn't tame me
Then my body memory kicks in
Blossoms and embraces
Oral, anal entrances
Enjoy the satisfaction
If the other is growing
