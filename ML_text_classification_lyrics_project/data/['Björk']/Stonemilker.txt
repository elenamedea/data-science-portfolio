A juxtaposition in fate
Find our mutual coordinate

Moments of clarity
Are so rare
I better document this
At last the view
Is fierce
All that matters is

Who is open-chested? 
And who has coagulated?
Who can share? 
And who has shut down the chances?

Show me emotional respect
Oh respect, oh respect
I have emotional needs
Oh needs

I wish to synchronize our feelings
Our feelings

What is it that I have
That makes me feel your pain?
Like milking a stone
To get you to say it

Who is open? 
And who has shut up? 
And if one feels closed, 
How does one stay open?

We have emotional needs
Oh needs, oh needs
I wish to synchronize our feelings
Our feelings
Show some emotional respect
Oh respect
