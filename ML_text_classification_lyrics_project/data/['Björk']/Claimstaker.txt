I walk through this land
Stake a claim
With my scent
With my back
With my nest, with sand (mark my nest)
Hear the, the echo from (echo from the cliff)
I draw this line through lake
To take a physicality
I inhale physicality
This forest is in me
This forest is in me
I immerse me in these hills

This is my home oh oh
This is definitely my home, ooh ooh ooh

All this, all this, all this, this is
