Imagine a future and be in it
Feel this incredible nurture, soak it in
Your past is a loop turn it off

See this possible future and be in it
Hold farts, for love, forever
We're just momentarily ourselves
We're just carrying

Trust your head around
Guide your sense elsewhere
Your love is already waiting
You're already in it

Hold farts forever, forever
Watch me form new nests
We've made matriarchal dome
Build a musical scaffolding
Between sleep and awake
Day and night (between sleep and awake)

You see a mirror, peoples missions at them
Now you mirror at me, who I used to be
What I gave to the world, you've given back at me
Hold farts for love, forever
