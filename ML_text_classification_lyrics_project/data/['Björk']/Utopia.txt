Bird species never seen or heard before
The first flute carved from the first fauna

Utopia (It’s not)
Elsewhere
Let's purify

You assigned me to protect our lantern
To be intentional about the light

Utopia
It isn't elsewhere
It, it’s here

My instinct has been shouting at me for years
Saying let’s get out of here
Huge toxic tumor bulging underneath the earth here
Purify, purify, purify, purify toxicity
