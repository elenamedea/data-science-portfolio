We are all solemn
From hiding his affairs
Let's put it all on the table
Let it all out

It is time
He mustn't steal our light

Clean it

Tabula rasa for my children
(Clean it)
Not repeating the f*ck-ups of the fathers

My deepest wish is that you’re immersed in grace and dignity
But you’ll have to deal with shit soon enough
I hope to give you the least amount of luggage
Got the right to make your own fresh mistakes
And not repeat other's failures

(Clean it) 
Tabula rasa for my children
(Let's clean it)
Break the chains of the f*ck-ups of the fathers
(It is) For us women to rise and not just take it lying down

(It is) The world, it is listening
Our whole way, love you
Embarrased to pass this mess over to you
But it let two lifes
Thought ours was the only ones (he chose to, he rose too)
