I wrote a love song
'Cause you're so loveable
I carried a watermelon
I wanna be vulnerable

I will not go to bars
Or jump in strangers' cars
Her mind's sweet, for wines, aligns, aligns, aligns, aligns
It's not about the sex and sex and sex and sex and sex and sex
I wanna be your best ever friend forever
Best friend

This modern love 
This modern love 
This modern love 
This modern love 

I really love you
I really love you
Look at the card I bought
It says "I love you"

You try, you try, you try, you try
To make me change
I hope and I pray and I pray and I pray
To stay the same
I wish, ish, ish, ish, ish,ish
I wish you'll always stay
So I push, ush, ush, ush, ush, ush
I push you away

This modern love 
This modern love 
This modern love 
This modern love

You give me power
You give me power
You're like a gun or a knife
Be my wife

This modern love 
This modern love 
This modern love 
This modern love 

This modern love
Modern love
Don't love
Love
